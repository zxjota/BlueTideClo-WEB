    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Third-Party Data</h3>
    <p>We may receive information about you from third-party services you connect to (for example, if you choose to sign in using a third-party account). We only retain such information if it is necessary for the Services or if you consent to sharing.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for purposes including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the App and provide customer support.</li>
      <li>To personalize and develop features (for example, saving and displaying your catch history and statistics).</li>
      <li>To send you transactional messages and respond to your requests.</li>
      <li>To analyze usage trends and diagnose technical issues.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect our rights.</li>
    </ul>

      <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> If BlueTideClo (or substantially all of its assets) is acquired, merged, or transferred, user information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

    <h2>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We and our service providers may use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you, maintain preferences, and analyze usage. On mobile devices this may include local storage and advertising identifiers. You can usually control cookies through your device or browser settings.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards intended to protect your information. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to or stored by the App. If we learn of a security breach that affects your personal information, we will follow applicable legal obligations to notify you and authorities where required.</p>
